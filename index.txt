I did not submit an Introduction for Module 1. Below is what I would have put down had I submitted the assignment itself.

Lyn Fares - Section 02 (Dr. Case)

Hello, everyone. My name is Lindsey, but I go by either that or Lyn. I am currently working towards a degree in Interactive Digital Media: Computer Science Programming (IDM:CS) and will be completing it this coming spring.

I am from Kansas City, Missouri and have lived there my whole life. I do not have any other degrees, so I don't have any past schools as far as universities are concerned. I was, however, enrolled in the Center School District for the entire 13 years of my Kindergarten to 12th grade experience. While I was in middle school, I participated in engineering challenges and competitions. In high school, I took a building blocks of coding class. My hobbies include art (drawing), baking / cooking, and playing Dungeons and Dragons with my friends.

After graduation, I don't care where I go as long as I can get a job in my field. Getting your foot in the door for most careers is the best you can do when first starting out. However, my dream job eventually be to work as part of a video game design or translation team. That way, I can put both my major and minor to good use. I also wouldn't mind being a webpage translator as well.

Something interesting about me is that I have played flute for 14 years now. I am in the Bearcat Marching Band (BMB) on campus and have been for a while (this is my 6th year with them). Here is the link to my LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/lindsey-fares-4b638b192/
